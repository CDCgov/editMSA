# Edit MSA

A collection of scripts for editing multiple sequence alignments, usually in [FASTA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FASTA_format) format. Some functionality may exist for downstream processes and may not be generally useful.

## Overview

| Script                 | Author        | Description                                                                                                                                                      | Notes                                                               |

| *codonCorrect.pl*      | S. S. Shpeard | Corrects insertions (given by the [TSV](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tab-separated_values)) and deletions to be in-frame using the MSA stats.                   | Deprecated.                                                         |
| *codonCorrectStats.pl* | S. S. Shepard | Corrects insertions (given by the TSV) and deletions to be in-frame using user-supplied statistics in Perl [storable format](https://perldoc.perl.org/Storable). | Used by dais-ribosome (GitHub pending).                             |
| *displayStats.pl*      | S. S. Shepard | Useful for displaying the codon-weight matrix used by `codonCorrectStats.pl`.                                                                                    | Uses Perl storable format.                                          |
| *storeStats.pl*        | S. S. Shepard | Takes an MSA and produces a codon-weight matrix in Perl storable format.                                                                                         | Format used by `codonCorrectStats.pl`                               |
| *fillSequences.pl*     | S. S. Shepard | Re-inserts insertions from a TSV (ID / Position / Insert) back into the MSA.                                                                                     |                                                                     |
| *ordinalHeaders.pl*    | S. S. Shepard | Changes FASTA headers to an ordinal `S#`. Has various options for annotating.                                                                                    |                                                                     |
| *removeGapColumns.pl*  | S. S. Shepard | Various options for dealing with gap columns in an MSA, including K-tons.                                                                                        | Overwrites in-place                                                 |
| *reviseTaxa.pl*        | S. S. Shepard | Revises annotation taxa in an MSA.                                                                                                                               | A component of the [LABEL MS](https://wonder.cdc.gov/amd/flu/label) |
| *shiftAlignment.pl* | S. S. Shepard | Shifts alignments to the left or right at a particular region. Useful for gaps before manual editing. ||
| *sortFASTA.pl*         | S. S. Shepard | Sorts the FASTA file by the header or a designatd set of fields.                                                                                                                              |                                                                     |
| *stripSequences.pl* | S. S. Shepard | Strips unwanted characters from a FASTA file. | FASTA may be unaligned after this operation. |
| *treeOrderedFasta.pl* | S. S. Shepard | Orders the FASTA file using a provided Newick where IDs or headers match. ||
| *diceAlignment.pl*     | S. S. Shepard | Chops alignment at specified region into a de-duplicated MSA for editing and downstream splicing.                                                                | Used in tandem with `spliceAlignment.pl`                            |
| *spliceAlignment.pl*   | S. S. Shepard | Takes the manually edited miniNT or miniAA file and splices it back into a full nucleotide alignment.                                                            | Used in tandem with `diceAlignment.pl`                              |
